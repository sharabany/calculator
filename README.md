calculator - spring boot restful web service 

Welcome to my calculator!

Here you can meet the Spring Bot Restful application.

There are 3 commits(you can see comits by list).
These commits are the way to start with the basics and progress to the perfect solution:

1.Basic use of Spring Bot principles. A simple and easy-to-understand example. For beginners with web service writing.

2.Map with function to run - In case and the number of possible actions for more or less permanent execution - the MAP form is very efficient and gives an easy option to add support for further action.

3. Best - use of reflection. Short, clean and most importantly - supports additional operations in the calculator: percentage, root and the like.

You will be impressed by the exeptions treatment, from the reference to end cases the code cover by unit test and an example of component test.

Good Luck!
