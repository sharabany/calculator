# calculator - spring boot restful web service 

Welcome to my calculator!

Here you can meet the Spring Boot Restful application.

There are 3 commits(you can see comits by list).
These commits are the way to start with the basics and progress to the perfect solution:

1.Basic use of Spring Bot principles. A simple and easy-to-understand example. For beginners with web service writing.

2.Map with function to run - In case and the number of possible actions for more or less permanent execution - the MAP form is very efficient and gives an easy option to add support for further action.

3.Best - use of reflection. Short, clean and most importantly - supports additional operations in the calculator: percentage, root and the like.

Exceptions and end cases are properly handled, the code is covered with unit testing and there is an example of component test.

Good Luck!
